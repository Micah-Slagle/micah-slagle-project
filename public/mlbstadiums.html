        <img src="photos/kauffmanstadium.jpg" alt="Kauffman Stadium" title="Kauffman Stadium" width="40%" float="left"/>
        <p>Kauffman Stadium is home to the Kansas City Royals. I've spent many days there during Kansas City Summers.</p>

    <h4>T-Mobile Park</h4> 
	<div id="row2">
        <p>
            T-Mobile Park is home to the Seattle Mariners. I went to Seattle on vacation once, and they happened to
            be playing the Royals during the vacation so my family and I went to a game. The stadium was quite nice.

        <img src="photos/buschstadium_0.jpg" alt="Busch Stadium" title="Busch Stadium" width="40%" float="left" />
        <p>
            Busch Stadium is Home to the Saint Louis Cardinals. I've gone to a couple of games there while visiting
            friends and family. I really enjoy how the skyline of the city is visible out above center field.
